## LangChain Course

In this course, I got familiar with the LangChain framework through practical labs.

- Lab 1: involved making direct API calls to OpenAI and implementing API interactions via LangChain, focusing on how prompts, models and output parsers are used.
- Lab 2: covered LangChain’s memory mechanisms. I worked with several types of memory, including ConversationBufferMemory, ConversationBufferWindowMemory, ConversationTokenBufferMemory, and ConversationSummaryMemory.
- Lab 3: used different chain types in LangChain. This included implementing LLMChain, Sequential Chains, SimpleSequentialChain, SequentialChain, and Router Chain.
- Lab 4: involved developing a tool for Q&A over documents. An example was creating a tool that queries a product catalog to find items of interest.
- Lab 5: focused on LangChain’s evaluation methods. I practiced example generation, manual evaluation and debugging, LLM-assisted evaluation, and utilized the LangChain evaluation platform.
- Lab 6: introduced LangChain agents. I used built-in tools like ArXiv and Wikipedia, but also defined custom tools.
