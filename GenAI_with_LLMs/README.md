## Generative AI with Large Language Models

In this course, I explored the fundamentals of GenAI with LLMs and applied various tachniques through hands-on labs.

1. Lab 1: Performed experiments with prompt engineering, comparing zero-shot, one-shot and few-shot inference methods for dialogue summarization tasks using GenAI.
2. Lab 2: Fine-tuned a FLAN-T5 model, evaluated the results with ROUGE metrics and performed Parameter Efficient Fine Tuning (PEFT).
3. Lab 3: Used Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to fine-tune the FLAN-T5 model and reduce its toxicity, using Meta AI's hate speech reward model.
