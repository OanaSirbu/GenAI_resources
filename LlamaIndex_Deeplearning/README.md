## Building Agentic RAG with Llamaindex Course

In this course, I learned how to build agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems using the Llamaindex framework through practical labs.

- Lab 1: created a router engine with summary and vector tools. 
- Lab 2: covered how to call and use different tools within Llamaindex to enhance the RAG system's capabilities.
- Lab 3: built an agent reasoning loop. 
- Lab 4: constructed a multi-document agent (that can handle and reason across multiple documents).
